## Guidelines for the Assignment: 

The Digital Literacy Narrative is a progressive assignment in *three* steps, which will be completed over the course of the semester, as well as being graded twice. 

**Step 1**: copy the response provided by `chatGPT` given below and to place it in your highest level folder as a file named `dln.md`. You can use the `yaml` header in this same file and remove the prompt and guidelines. This first stage is ungraded.  

**Step 1 Due date:** ASAP, ungraded.

**Step 2**: rewrite the file to reflect the kind of digital literacies you feel that you have and that you want to work on. Stay at approximately 500 words. Use a markdown cheatsheet such as this [one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to stylize your post, adding different layout features and embedded links if needed. You do not need to refer to the readings. Feel free to use multiple commits and commit messages explaining the kinds of changes you made. 

**Step 2 Due date:** 20 Feb, ungraded.

**Step 3**: At midterm, you will rewrite this post to reflect your current state of thinking on the question. You should increase the word limit to 750-1000 words. A rubric for how you can revise it will be provided. Make reference to an additional two resources from the course. 

**Step 3 Due date:** 5 April, 5% total grade.

> Hints for Step 3: 

- Make the language your own, by rewriting whole sentences rather than just changing a few words. 
- Think about the claims made by chatGPT and consider rewriting or adding additional information. 
- Add new material you have learned from the class as well as new terminology (check the agenda document).
- Make reference to two of the readings in class which we have had which discuss the points you bring up. 


**Step 4**: At the end of the term, you will rewrite the post to reflect your end-of-term state of thinking about digital literacies. You should increase the word limit to 1000-1250 words. You can go beyond that, but remember few people want to read more than 1600 words. Make reference to an additional two resources from the course (6 total). 

**Step 4 Due date:** 5 May, 5% total grade.

As a 20 year old university student studying digital humanities, I am constantly learning about how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I have always been familiar with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.

In my daily life, I mainly use social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter to connect with friends and family, as well as to follow my favorite influencers and brands. I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns.

For content creation, I use a variety of tools such as Canva and Adobe Spark to create graphics and videos for personal projects. I have also recently discovered the potential of using video editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere to enhance my content and make it more visually appealing.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis.

The digital humanities course has opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I have learned about tools such as Tableau and Gephi for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like Python and R for data manipulation and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

Despite my prior experience with technology and my newfound knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.
