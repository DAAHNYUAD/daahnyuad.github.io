## Exploring DOT 

According to the developer, DOT will work with an Apple Silicon chip (M1 or higher) or with a Windows machine. It is not currently supported for Linux. For this assignment you do not have to download DOT as we will demo it in class and try it with different kinds of materials. It is a large download that you can do at your own risk if you choose to try it out for yourself.


## Exploring DOT with sensitive historical archives: 

In the words of its creators, DOT is "a standalone, open-source application designed for seamless interaction with documents and files." It was created in the spring of 2024 by an MSc student at UCL. It is built with the Phi-3.5 LLM.

DOT has a graphic user interface allowing you to load multiple documents into an LLM and to interact with them in a fully local environment. There is also Big DOT that acts a bit like chatGPT for questions not related to the documents you have uploaded.
