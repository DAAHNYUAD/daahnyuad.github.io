Rewrite a handful of small details in the file to reflect the kind of digital literacies you feel that you have and that you want to work on this semester. Stay at approximately 500 words. Use a markdown cheatsheet such as this [one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to stylize your post, adding different layout features and embedded links if needed. You do not need to refer to the readings. Feel free to use multiple commits and commit messages explaining the kinds of changes you made. Include a screenshot of a side-by-side change in GitHub to illustrate the changes you have made. Make sure you caption the image. 

Interesting thought: Is there anything in the early `chatGPT` version (30 Jan version) that is different from the most recent one that you want to adopt? 

**Step 1 Due date:** 14 September, ungraded.

**Step 2**: At midterm, you will rewrite this post to reflect your current state of thinking on the question. You should increase the word limit to 750-1000 words. A rubric for how you can revise it will be provided. Make reference to an additional two resources from the course. 

**Step 2 Due date:** 12 October, 5% total grade.

> Hints for Step 2: 

- Make the language your own, by rewriting whole sentences rather than just changing a few words. 
- Think about the claims made by chatGPT, their clarity, accuracy and relevance and consider rewriting or adding additional information. 
- Add new material you have learned from the class as well as new terminology.
- Make reference to two of the readings/resources in class which we have had which discuss the points you bring up. 


**Step 3**: At the end of the term, you will rewrite the post to reflect your end-of-term state of thinking about digital literacies. You should increase the word limit to 1000-1250 words. You can go beyond that, but remember few people want to read more than [1500-2000 words](https://rockcontent.com/blog/how-long-should-a-blog-post-be/). Make reference to an additional two resources from the course (4 total). 

**Step 3 Due date:** 1 December, 5% total grade.

Guiding questions for step 3: 
- What are the platforms you might use now? for what? 
- What were you good at in digital environments? What are the most significant new points you learned? 
- What can you still use some improvement in? 
- What are you learning about new domains of thinking about data?
- How do you feel with working and learning with AI?

As a 20 year old university student studying digital humanities, I am constantly learning about how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I have always been familiar with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.

In my daily life, I mainly use social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter to connect with friends and family, as well as to follow my favorite influencers and brands. I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns.

For content creation, I use a variety of tools such as Canva and Adobe Spark to create graphics and videos for personal projects. I have also recently discovered the potential of using video editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere to enhance my content and make it more visually appealing.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis.

The digital humanities course has opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I have learned about tools such as Tableau and Gephi for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like Python and R for data manipulation and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

Despite my prior experience with technology and my newfound knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.

**Response from chatGPT:** This is the 3 August 2023 version for the same prompt.

Title: Navigating the Digital Wilderness: My Journey into Digital Humanities

As a 20-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. Little did I know that it would transform the way I perceive, interact with, and create content in the digital realm. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I knew how to use social media platforms, compose emails, and write research papers using Microsoft Word. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and I hardly ventured beyond that comfort zone. Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication.

In my daily life, I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling, but I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited.

Enrolling in the Digital Humanities course was a pivotal moment. The course exposed me to a plethora of digital tools and concepts that have broadened my horizons. I learned about content management systems like WordPress, which opened up new avenues for blogging and website creation. Markdown language became my go-to for formatting text, and platforms like GitHub allowed me to collaborate with others on coding projects.

Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I explored platforms like Slack, Discord, and Reddit, which facilitated discussions and collaboration in ways I had never experienced before. I began to see how online communities formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into research data management and analysis. Tools like Zotero and Mendeley revolutionized the way I organize and cite my sources, making research more efficient and organized. We explored data manipulation with Python and data visualization with tools like Tableau, illuminating the power of data-driven insights.

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, my journey into digital humanities has been a transformative experience. From a basic digital literacy background, I have ventured into the realms of content creation, social interaction, and research data management and analysis. While my current abilities have grown, I am acutely aware of the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be explored. My aspirations include mastering data analysis, understanding the ethical complexities of the digital world, and continuing to adapt and evolve as a digital citizen. This course has opened my eyes to the possibilities and responsibilities that come with digital literacy, and I am excited to continue my journey in this ever-evolving digital wilderness.
