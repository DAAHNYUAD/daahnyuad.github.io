## DRAFT Guidelines for the Assignment:  

In this assignment we will continue to work with materials and algorithms discussed in class. We will use Orange Data Mining to carry out this task. 

### Part One: 

The first exercise is a clustering exercise. You should choose a corpus of images (somewhere between 50-200 would be best). As we discussed in class, it is possible to choose particular images from a large dataset found at places like Kaggle, but the topic should be something that you know something about. In the second part you will classify them into subtypes. Choosing a dataset of images you are not very interested in, or a dataset that you have enough knowledge to categorize will make it difficult. 

I suggest you use this part of the assignment to do some exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using the pre-set Orange Data Mining workflow I distributed (images2.ows), you can address the following questions: 

- How does a built-in algorithm in ODM cluster the data? 
- Do other algorithms give you different results? 
- What features seem to be most characteristic of the different quadrants of the image plot? 
- Using hierarchical clustering, isolate specific clusters to look more closely.



### Part Two:

In the second exercise you 


In your write up, you should include insights and ideas from the new book Distant Viewing (Arnold & Tilton). 

Make sure that you include images from your analysis.
