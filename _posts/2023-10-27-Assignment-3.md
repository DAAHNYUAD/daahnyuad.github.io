# Guidelines for the Assignment: 

The Spatial Data Assignment is an assignment in one step. It builds upon the work we did in class on October 17th. 

This assignment can be done alone or in pairs.  

This exercise has four main elements: (1) identifying the spatial elements of any humanities source material (2) modeling a spatial dataset based on those elements, (3) enriching the spatial data with any other relevant metadata, (4) visualizing the data on a map, discussion and interpretion.

**Step 1**: Choice of source. You should identify the sourcebook you would like to work with. Below is a list of possible sources from archive.org, but you can also find your own. **Please check with the instructor if you use one which is not included below**. 

Source #1 [The Brooklyn City and Business Directory 1879-80](https://archive.org/details/1880BPL/page/n21/mode/2up). This directory contains names of people, their professions and street addresses. The text is already available. This source will be particularly good if you are interested in the history of New York City.  

Source #2 [Radio and Television Annual year Book (1962)](https://archive.org/details/radioannual1962/mode/2up). For this source, it would make sense to pick one of the categories (advertising agencies, transcription companies, etc.)

Source #3 [Travel Gudie to Chennai](https://archive.org/details/TravelGuideToChennai/mode/2up).

Source #4 [Fielding's Travel Guide to Europe](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.149144/page/n1/mode/2up)

Source #5 [Standard Guide to Cuba, 1905](https://archive.org/details/standardguideto00cogoog/mode/2up)

Source #6 [Promenade dans Paris-in French](https://archive.org/details/promenadedanspar0000viei/page/n1/mode/2up). This source would require OCR. 

Source #7 [An Atlas of Ancient Egypt](https://archive.org/details/cu31924026363097/mode/2up)

Source #8 [UAE Exports & Industry Directory - 2017-18](https://archive.org/details/Directory_201704/mode/2up)

Source #9 [Smolensk Telephone Book from 1910 - in Russian Список абонентов Смоленской телефонной сети, устроенной и эксплуатируемой Правительством](https://archive.org/details/1910-smolensk-tspr-1910/mode/2up). 

If your source has not been optically character recognized (OCR'd), you need to do this. You can reach out to the instructor to help with this. 

**Step 2**: Modeling the data. You should identify what data is available from the source. 

For some sources, the number of pages involved may make it very difficult to extract all the information. You should make a choice of which part of the source you will work on. You want to have a dataset of at least 50 rows or so. If you use chatGPT to extract the data, please make sure that the number of rows is significantly larger than that. 

**Step 3**:  Enriching the data.  Geocoding. Adding any other data. 

**Step 4**:  Visualizing the data. Discussion and Interpretation. 





*Images* : For images, you need to take a single screenshot (either of the two images together in Mirador or otherwise placed along side of each other), rename that file and place it in the assets folder of your Github pages site. Insert the following line where you want the image to show up in the body of the .md file of your assignment:

`<img src="/assets/{filename}.png" style="zoom:50%"/>`

Use the zoom percentage to size the file. An example of the code of one of your instructor's research projects can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parisbible/parisbible.github.io/main/_posts/2022-10-31-bible-hunting-Italy.md)

**Step 3**: You should discuss the metadata given for the image(s). You might create a table which compares and constrasts what you are able to know about the items and their potential relationship. Remember that metadata is often imported in the language of the original library and there can be a mismatch between the library's version and what you see here. Do they come from the same library? different libraries? How does that affect their metadata? 

**Step 4** How complete or certain is the metadata? Can you make a search engine query for elements of the metadata, or combinations of the metadata and find the objects? 

**Step 5** What other kinds of metadata can you find about the objects, either at the home libraries or by doing some basic research. What kinds of metadata categories might you add that would make the items more discoverable? 

Your assignment should be about 1000 words long, with several images, embedded links. Use a markdown cheatsheet such as this [one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to stylize your post, adding different layout features and embedded links if needed. You can refer to the readings if you want to, but this is not necessary for this assignment. **Due date: 2 March**.


**Response from chatGPT:** This is the 30 January 2023 version.

> What is the importance of metadata to the discoverability of cultural objects in federated digital libraries?  How complete are they usually? What is the cost of metadata? How can we make it better? 

*Metadata is critical to the discoverability of cultural objects in federated digital libraries. It serves as a bridge between the physical object and the digital representation of that object, providing information about its creator, subject, format, and other relevant details. Metadata allows users to search, browse, and filter digital collections, which is essential to finding the resources they need.*

*Incomplete metadata can have a significant impact on the discoverability of cultural objects. For example, if an object is missing key metadata, such as its creator or date, it may not show up in search results or may be difficult to find among other similar objects. Additionally, inconsistent or inaccurate metadata can lead to confusion or errors when using digital libraries.*

*The cost of metadata varies depending on the size and complexity of the collection, as well as the resources available for creating and maintaining metadata. Creating high-quality metadata can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring skilled staff and specialized tools. However, the cost of metadata can be reduced through the use of automated tools and crowdsourcing, which can help to streamline the process and make it more cost-effective.*

*To make metadata better, it is important to invest in creating high-quality metadata at the outset of a project and to maintain it over time. This requires a commitment to standards and best practices for metadata creation and management, as well as ongoing training and support for staff involved in metadata creation. Additionally, it is important to involve end-users in the process of creating metadata, as they can provide valuable insights and feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the metadata.*

**optional**: You can respond to what you think about this answer in the context of your research.
