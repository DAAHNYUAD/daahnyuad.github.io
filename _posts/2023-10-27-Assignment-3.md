# DRAFT Guidelines for the Assignment: 

The Spatial Data Assignment is an assignment in one step. It builds upon the work we did in class on October 17th. 

This assignment can be done alone or in pairs.  

This exercise has four main elements: (1) identifying the spatial elements of any humanities source material (2) modeling a spatial dataset based on those elements, (3) enriching the spatial data with any other relevant metadata, (4) visualizing the data on a map, discussion and interpretion.

**Step 1**: Choice of source. You should identify the sourcebook you would like to work with. Below is a list of possible sources from archive.org, but you can also find your own. **Please check with the instructor if you use one which is not included below**. 

Source #1 [The Brooklyn City and Business Directory 1879-80](https://archive.org/details/1880BPL/page/n21/mode/2up). This directory contains names of people, their professions and street addresses. The text is already available. This source will be particularly good if you are interested in the history of New York City.  

Source #2 [Radio and Television Annual year Book (1962)](https://archive.org/details/radioannual1962/mode/2up). For this source, it would make sense to pick one of the categories (advertising agencies, transcription companies, etc.)

Source #3 [Travel Guide to Chennai](https://archive.org/details/TravelGuideToChennai/mode/2up).

Source #4 [Fielding's Travel Guide to Europe](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.149144/page/n1/mode/2up)

Source #5 [Standard Guide to Cuba, 1905](https://archive.org/details/standardguideto00cogoog/mode/2up)

Source #6 [Promenade dans Paris-in French](https://archive.org/details/promenadedanspar0000viei/page/n1/mode/2up). This source would require OCR. 

Source #7 [An Atlas of Ancient Egypt](https://archive.org/details/cu31924026363097/mode/2up)

Source #8 [UAE Exports & Industry Directory - 2017-18](https://archive.org/details/Directory_201704/mode/2up)

Source #9 [Smolensk Telephone Book from 1910 - in Russian Список абонентов Смоленской телефонной сети, устроенной и эксплуатируемой Правительством](https://archive.org/details/1910-smolensk-tspr-1910/mode/2up). 

If your source has not been optically character recognized (OCR'd), you need to do this. You can reach out to the instructor to help with this. 

**Step 2**: Modeling the data. You should identify what data is available from the source. 

For some sources, the number of pages involved may make it very difficult to extract all the information. You should make a choice of which part of the source you will work on. You want to have a dataset of at least 50 rows or so. If you use chatGPT to extract the data, please make sure that the number of rows is significantly larger than that. 

**Step 3**:  Enriching the data.  Geocoding. Adding any other data. 

**Step 4**:  Visualizing the data. Discussion and Interpretation. 


*Images* : For images, you need to take a single screenshot (either of the two images together in Mirador or otherwise placed along side of each other), rename that file and place it in the assets folder of your Github pages site. Insert the following line where you want the image to show up in the body of the .md file of your assignment:

`<img src="/assets/{filename}.png" style="zoom:50%"/>`

Use the zoom percentage to size the file. An example of the code of one of your instructor's research projects can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parisbible/parisbible.github.io/main/_posts/2022-10-31-bible-hunting-Italy.md)

Your assignment should be about 1250 words long, with several images, embedded links. Use a markdown cheatsheet such as this [one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to stylize your post, adding different layout features and embedded links if needed. You can refer to the readings if you want to, but this is not necessary for this assignment. **Due date: 15 November**.
