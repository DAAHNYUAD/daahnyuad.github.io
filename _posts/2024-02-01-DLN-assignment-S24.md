> Hints for Step 1: 

- Rewrite a handful of details in the file to reflect the kind of digital literacies you feel that you have and that you want to work on this semester. 
- Adjust the perspective to be your own. 
- Stay at approximately 750 words.
- Use a markdown cheatsheet such as this [one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to stylize your post, adding different layout features and embedded links if needed. 
- You do not need to refer to the readings at this point, but you might be interested in the recent article "[The Role of Culture in the Intelligence of AI](https://www.transcript-publishing.com/978-3-8376-6710-3/ai-in-museums/?number=978-3-8394-6710-7)". 
- Feel free to use multiple commits and commit messages explaining the kinds of changes you made. 
- Practice your Github Pages skills by including a screenshot of a side-by-side change in GitHub to illustrate the changes you have made. - Make sure you caption the image.
- it is possible, but not requried, to reshape the prompt to reflect your specific perspective and to generate a different starting point. In this case, indicate that you have done this, include what GPT provided and then revise.

**Note on declaring your use of GPT:** You should use the guidelines set forth by Arxiv about using GPT. link forthcoming.

> Hints for Step 2: 

- Make the language your own, by rewriting whole sentences rather than just changing some concepts or clauses. 
- Think about the claims made by chatGPT, their clarity, accuracy and relevance and consider rewriting or adding additional information. 
- Add new material you have learned from the class as well as new terminology.
- Make reference to two of the readings/resources in class which we have had which discuss the points you bring up, linking outward to them on the web or in the library catalog using their permalinks. 


**Step 3**: At the end of the term, you will rewrite the post to reflect your end-of-term state of thinking about digital literacies. You should increase the word limit to 1500-1750 words. You can go beyond that, but remember few people want to read more than [1500-2000 words](https://rockcontent.com/blog/how-long-should-a-blog-post-be/). Make reference to an additional two resources from the course (4 total). 

**Step 3 Due date:** 25 April 2024, 5% total grade.

Sample prompt for Step 1: 

> Please write a 750 word reflection on digital literacy from the perspective of a 20 year old university student majoring. Include strategies they might already know how to employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, as well as any platforms or software they use for research data management as well as data manipulation and analysis. Consider the different skill set in the room given all the interdisicplinary majors ( in different fields such as Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, even Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature or Creative Writing). Reflect on how digital humanities might offer new horizons on what they are studying, how collaboration might offer new avenues for developing their "computational thinking" and how they can learn about new ways of approaching data and the world of AI. Offer critical reflection on your current abilities, what you are what you are discovering in the course as well as what kinds of new ways of thinking you would like to explore.

The GPT 3.5 response on 1 February 2024: 

As a 20-year-old university student, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in an introductory course in digital humanities. What made this experience particularly enriching was the diverse group of classmates who joined me. Our majors spanned a wide spectrum of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. Together, we have explored digital literacy, each bringing a unique set of strategies and skills into the classroom.

Before immersing ourselves in the world of digital humanities, we had already developed our own strategies for navigating the digital landscape in both daily life and academics. As a Computer Science major, I was well-versed in coding languages such as Python and Java, using them for content creation, software development, and data manipulation. My academic journey was marked by problem-solving, algorithm design, and collaborative coding through platforms like GitHub.

My peers from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing had their own digital toolkits. Interactive Media students excelled in user-centered design and interactive storytelling, often utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite. Film and New Media enthusiasts delved into multimedia production and digital narrative creation. Environmental Studies majors leveraged data analysis software for environmental research, while Business and Marketing students honed their skills in data analytics platforms for market analysis. Students in Literature and Creative Writing dived deep into research databases to fuel their literary and artistic pursuits.

However, the digital humanities course has illuminated the intersection of our diverse disciplines in the digital age. Content creation, once thought to be confined to specific fields, took on a multidisciplinary dimension. We explored creating interactive websites, digital art installations, immersive narratives, and AI-generated content. Our collaborative efforts showcased the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, blurring the lines between art, science, and storytelling.

Social interaction and collaboration also evolved. Platforms like Slack, Discord, and online forums became hubs for exchanging ideas, sparking discussions, and collaborating on projects. We found ourselves engaging in thought-provoking conversations that spanned our areas of expertise, enriching our perspectives and generating innovative ideas. Collaborating across disciplines proved to be a catalyst for creativity and interdisciplinary thinking.

Research data management and manipulation emerged as a common thread that united us all. We delved into text analysis, data visualization, and digital archives. Tools like Zotero and Omeka became invaluable for organizing, annotating, and sharing research materials. The importance of data literacy transcended individual majors, equipping us to navigate the data-driven landscape of the digital age.

Our critical reflection on our current abilities led us to appreciate the concept of "computational thinking" in the age of AI. We understood that skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation were universally valuable, regardless of our major. As AI continues to shape our world, these skills will empower us to harness its potential for innovation and informed decision-making.

Digital humanities has broadened our horizons, offering fresh perspectives on our respective fields of study. We began to contemplate the ethical implications of AI and data usage within our disciplines. Computer Science majors questioned the ethical responsibilities of AI developers, while Literature and Creative Writing students considered the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. Environmental Studies majors explored AI's potential in climate change monitoring, and Business and Marketing students delved into AI-driven market analysis.

Looking ahead, we are excited to continue our exploration of new ways of thinking and working. We aim to cultivate a holistic approach to education that recognizes the value of interdisciplinary thinking in a digitally driven world. We envision a future where collaboration between artists, scientists, scholars, and creators becomes the norm, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of our fields.

In conclusion, our journey through digital humanities has been transformative. It has expanded our horizons, bridged the gap between technology and the humanities, and equipped us with a multifaceted understanding of digital literacy. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, we are poised to embrace new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In the age of AI, we are ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
