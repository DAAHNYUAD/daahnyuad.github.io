# DRAFT Guidelines for the Assignment: 

The Cultural Heritage By the Numbers is an assignment in one step. It builds upon the work we did in class on September 12 and 14 using the Jupyter notebooks in posit.cloud. 

This assignment can be done alone or in pairs. If it is done in pairs, please compose one markdown file which you place in both student sites. 

This exercise focuses on exhibitions that have been documented at the Harvard Art Museum the information about which has been obtained via the museum API. You can think of this assignment a way of doing an "archeology" of past art exhibitions. 

**Section 1**: Explore the HAM [website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/) as well as the csv file included. Choose two favorite exhibitions and record their unique IDs. Was one method of finding the exhibitions easier than the other? What are you able to say about the exhibitions from the highest level metadata? Can you find any other information about the exhibitions on the web? 

**Section 2**: Filtering by exhibition ID, build a list of objects which are recorded as appearing in the same exhibition. What can you glean from this basic information? Build a word cloud based on the combined descriptions and titles. Does this summary of the words tell us something about the exhibition? 

**Section 3**: What are the x most viewed items in the exhibition? The x least viewed? Do these count suggest something about the nature of exhibition ("greatest hits" or a discover of unknown objects?) Are these numbers suprising to you? Do they tell you something about the relative popularity of the exhibition? 

Repeat this process for another exhibition and compare. Are there noticeable data gaps? 

**Advanced optional extra step:** 

1. Can you adapt the code to look for the most common colors? The most common techniques? Or any other value from the attributes? 


Your assignment does not need to answer all the questions above, nor does it need to follow the sections step by step.  It should be about 1250-1500 words long, with relevant images saved from the notebooks, embedded links, etc. Use a markdown cheatsheet such as this [one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to stylize your post, adding different layout features and embedded links if needed. You can refer to the readings if you want to, but this is not necessary for this assignment. 

**Assignment 1 Due date:** 28 September, 20% final grade.
