## Guidelines for the Post: 

Sometimes I will assign an optional extra credit opportunity. It will usually be in the form of an event (sometimes a remote event) to attend. These opportunities are entirely optional.

To receive the amount of credit I specify, please make sure that you include the following: 

- the date, time and location of the event
- a summary of the main points of the event
- any links to tutorials or open data shared with you at the event
- any links to other learning resources which can help a beginner learn
- at least two relevant images, captioned and attributed with embedded links
- a description of how the subject connects to anything you have done so far in Intro to DAAH
- a small statement on where you think you might be able to use what you have learned: in classes, in capstone, in future work. 

In short, your audience for this post is implicitly your instructor, but try to target someone who knows nothing about the topic (like fellow students). 

The target length is 1000-1250 words with 2 images. Use well-formed Markdown text that clearly shows the various segments of your post and provides embedded links. 

Remember to be respectful of people attending remote events and not post screenshots of faces in Zoom windows. Keep your images relevant to the content of the event.

Note: You should complete all the points above to receive the extra points.
