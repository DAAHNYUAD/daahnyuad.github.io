# Guidelines for the Assignment: 

The DLME Metadata Assignment is an assignment in one step. It builds upon the work we did in class on February 7th. 

This assignment can be done alone or in pairs (either the ones from class or new ones).  

This exercise has two main elements: (1) illustrating how federated libraries can help us understand different kinds of relationships between objects found in global collections and (2) exploring the [discoverability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoverability) of the items given their metadata.

**Step 1**: You should identify two or three items from the [Digital Library of the Middle East](https://dlmenetwork.org/library). This platform "federates and makes accessible data about collections from around the world." NB: A good assignment will use a well chosen pair of items, similar in some ways and different in others. 

**Step 2**: You should obtain a version of the image of the item in your post, captioning it and making sure that you have cited it properly according to the license listed on the DLME. You may want to use detailed images of the items in addition to the whole image. If you would like to view the two objects together, use [Project Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/) with the IIIF manifest. NB: not all images in the DLME have a IIIF manifest. 

**OMITTED STEP 2b (2 March)**: For images, you need to take a single screenshot (either of the two images together in Mirador or otherwise placed along side of each other), rename that file and place it in the assets folder of your Github pages site. Insert the following line where you want the image to show up in the body of the .md file of your assignment:

<img src="/assets/{filename}.png" style="zoom:50%"/>

Use the zoom percentage to size the file. An example of the code of one of your instructor's research projects can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parisbible/parisbible.github.io/main/_posts/2022-10-31-bible-hunting-Italy.md)

**Step 3**: You should discuss the metadata given for the image(s). You might create a table which compares and constrasts what you are able to know about the items and their potential relationship. Remember that metadata is often imported in the language of the original library and there can be a mismatch between the library's version and what you see here. Do they come from the same library? different libraries? How does that affect their metadata? 

**Step 4** How complete or certain is the metadata? Can you make a search engine query for elements of the metadata, or combinations of the metadata and find the objects? 

**Step 5** What other kinds of metadata can you find about the objects, either at the home libraries or by doing some basic research. What kinds of metadata categories might you add that would make the items more discoverable? 

Your assignment should be about 1000 words long, with several images, embedded links. Use a markdown cheatsheet such as this [one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to stylize your post, adding different layout features and embedded links if needed. You can refer to the readings if you want to, but this is not necessary for this assignment. 

**Assignment 1 Due date:** 2 March, 20% final grade.

Here is how chatGPT responds to the follwing prompt about discoverability: 

> What is the importance of metadata to the discoverability of cultural objects in federated digital libraries?  How complete are they usually? What is the cost of metadata? How can we make it better? 

*Metadata is critical to the discoverability of cultural objects in federated digital libraries. It serves as a bridge between the physical object and the digital representation of that object, providing information about its creator, subject, format, and other relevant details. Metadata allows users to search, browse, and filter digital collections, which is essential to finding the resources they need.*

*Incomplete metadata can have a significant impact on the discoverability of cultural objects. For example, if an object is missing key metadata, such as its creator or date, it may not show up in search results or may be difficult to find among other similar objects. Additionally, inconsistent or inaccurate metadata can lead to confusion or errors when using digital libraries.*

*The cost of metadata varies depending on the size and complexity of the collection, as well as the resources available for creating and maintaining metadata. Creating high-quality metadata can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring skilled staff and specialized tools. However, the cost of metadata can be reduced through the use of automated tools and crowdsourcing, which can help to streamline the process and make it more cost-effective.*

*To make metadata better, it is important to invest in creating high-quality metadata at the outset of a project and to maintain it over time. This requires a commitment to standards and best practices for metadata creation and management, as well as ongoing training and support for staff involved in metadata creation. Additionally, it is important to involve end-users in the process of creating metadata, as they can provide valuable insights and feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the metadata.*

**optional**: You can respond to what you think about this answer in the context of your research.
