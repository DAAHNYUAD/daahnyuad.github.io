## Sample Rubrics:

### Rubric for Revision DLN

### Rubric for Assignments

Missing: no assignment done within the time allotted.

Unsatisfactory: some writing provided, but does not address the prompt or provide any reflection on the prompt, perhaps below the word limit. The author does not, in turn, complete the data portion of the assignment, or does so insufficiently. The data are not provided for download and are perhaps not well structured. Insufficient engagement with the concepts. Does not include sufficient visuals or they are uncaptioned. The assignments are difficult to find on your site.

Satisfactory: sufficient length of writing and the assignment addresses the prompt reflectively. The data are sufficiently created, presented and structured, but perhaps with flaws. The data are provided for download. The discussion of the assignment is good, but does not provide much critical reflection on the results and/or the process. Has captioned visuals, but are perhaps not well linked to the writing or unclear. The assignments are on your site, but are not in an easy to find order.

Excellent: The assignment is reflective, critical and well argued. The data are well described and well structured, and are available for easy download. The text of the assignment engages with the overall themes of the course, provides more than sufficient critical engagement. The visuals are well made, clearly captioned, providing strong evidence for the claims made in the writing. The assignments are on your site, and are listed in order as sub-pages (child pages) to a tab for "assignments".
