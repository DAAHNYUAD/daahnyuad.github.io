TEACHING AND LEARNING METHODOLOGIES:
This course will take place in both a seminar and a lab style, with discussion of pre-assigned readings and a lab session for hands-on learning.
The course will incorporate guest lecturers when possible. 
Since the course strives to use open and accessible methods, most hands-on work done during the lab session can be repeated asynchronously from students’ computers. Specialized labs or software will occasionally be required.
A laptop will be essential for almost every session. Sometimes a tablet or pad will not be sufficient. 
Students will work in teams to carry out small projects using what they have learned. They will also design, create and evaluate individual project concepts.
All course work is public and open in a digital web-based format, with an emphasis on creating a public portfolio. 
There is no final paper in this course, nor is there an exam.  Instead, students build a digital course portfolio along the way, consisting of a research website, a final plan for a research project relevant to their own intellectual interests.
