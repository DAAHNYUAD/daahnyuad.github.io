**GRADE CUTOFFS:** 

In the S23 semester, I will be using the following cutoffs. It may be necessary to lower them slightly in the final stages of grading for holistic evaluation. 

| grade | range | grade | range | grade | range | grade | range | grade | range |
| A | 100-93 | A- | 92-90 | B+ | 89-87 | B | 86-83 | B- | 82-80 |
| C+ | 79-77 | C | 76-73 | C- | 72-70 | D | 70-60 | F | 60 or below |


**ASSESSMENT:**

| Component | Percentage | Mapping to CLOs | Description  | 
| Digital narrative | 10% | (CLO 2, 4, 6) |  Students will write a digital literacy narrative at the beginning of term. It should include the strategies they currently employ in their daily and academic lives for content creation, social interaction, data manipulation and analysis. This will make up a page on the student’s own course site. It will be revised both at midterm and at the end of the term and assessed for growth and reflection. No credit is given for the first version, 5% is allotted for the second version, and 5% for the final. | 
| Participation | 10% | (CLO 1) | Active participation and regular attendance are expected of all students. Between the course meetings, students may have to investigate a problem to learn how to do it themselves— taking initiative will be rewarded. In addition, we come to the course with different skills and helping out fellow students and fostering a collaborative spirit in the classroom will be rewarded. Participation will be assessed by the extent to which the students have prepared for in-class discussion. | 
| Assignments/Responses | 60% | (CLO 1, 4, 5, 6, 7) | There will be four assignments in this course which grow out of hands-on work. They will be either reflective pieces on a conceptual issue that has arisen in class or a report or review about a project or experiment carried out; these assignments should incorporate lessons learned from the lab courses. These assignments can be done individually or in pairs, according to the directions. Students will learn how to create their own web presence through setting up a site of their own to host these assignments. The best three assignments will be counted (20% each). | 
| Final portfolio | 20% | (CLO 1, 3, 6, 7, 8) | Over the course of the term, students will be exposed to project-based learning. Students will carry out one small group un-project at the end of term using the ideas and methods we have covered in class. By un-project we mean that students will also conceptualize and describe a project building in values from the course, but they will not actually carry it out. This exercise draws on "big picture" thinking and will require reflective analysis and contextualization. Since student interest will be incorporated into the scoping and planning of final un-projects, a full range of historical & analytical humanities production to generative & theoretical arts production will be possible as student output. We will begin to work on these around the midterm and continue through the semester. One such model for these un-projects can be found in the case studies of Digital_Humanities.  One of the parts of the final portfolio will be to take the assignment the student likes the best and would like to disseminate in the world, and it should be presented (with a minimum of text and clear headlining) on a single slide. Full instructions for this assignment will be provided | 

Note on coursework submission: Final portfolios are individual even though final projects may be group-based. As with all course material submission, the student will use the web-publishing platform of their choice. A selection of these will be introduced in Lab 1 and skills in web publishing will be introduced in the lab sessions over the course of the semester). Examples of such sites will be provided to guide students. When group-based, it can be hosted in a single location and linked to, but each individual student must make a short write up about their own contribution. 

Note on Group work: any group work should be described according to the various contributions. Students can refer to a breakdown of contributions such as in the principles of the [Contributor Roles Typology](https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/blog/the-casrai-credit-typology) 


> There is no final paper in this course, nor is there an exam.  Instead, students build a digital course portfolio along the way, consisting of a research website, a final plan for a research project relevant to their own intellectual interests.
