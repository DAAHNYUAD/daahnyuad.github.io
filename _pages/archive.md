## IM-UH 1511 Archive

IM-UH 1511 Introduction to Digital Arts and Humanities is the foundation course for the minor in Digital Arts and Humanities. As the field is rapidly changing and we expect it to grow and change over the years, we will archive the markdown files for the key pages (schedule, materials, outcomes, assessment) here.
