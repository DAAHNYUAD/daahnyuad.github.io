# BRIEF COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Introduction to Digital Arts and Humanities examines different intersections between digital culture and objects of the digitized human record in the context of the rapidly evolving world of platforms and data. The course examines how the digital and the computational can provide new ways to explore and to study the arts and humanities. Key components of the course include varieties of data in the arts and humanities, the synergies of thinking and doing, collaborative and project-based work, as well as global disparities of cultural data. Methods introduced in the course may vary slightly from term to term, but could include web publishing or text editing, digital textual analysis, data modeling and visualization, algorithmic study of images, sound computing, social network analysis or digital mapping. The course assumes no prior technical skills, but a willingness to explore new technologies is essential for success.
