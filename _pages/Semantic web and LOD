Semantic web and LOD

- why do LLMs do better than keyword search
- missing context
- natural language has no explicit semantics understood by computers
- GPT can generate writing for human readers but not for "computational readers" 

original SW idea - extend the web with info
SW not exactly knowledge graphs

how many triples are needed for a knowledge graph? 

URIs need to remain stable

name spaces : each name is unique and only designates a specific object

ontologies : classes & relations
