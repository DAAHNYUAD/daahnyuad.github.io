## TEACHING AND LEARNING METHODOLOGIES:

This course will take place in both a seminar and a lab style, with discussion of pre-assigned readings and a lab session for hands-on learning.
- The course will incorporate guest lecturers when possible. 
- Since the course strives to use open and accessible methods, most hands-on work done during the lab session can be repeated asynchronously from students’ computers. Specialized labs or software will occasionally be required.
- A laptop will be essential for almost every session. Sometimes a tablet or pad will not be sufficient. 
- Students will work in teams to carry out small projects using what they have learned. They will also design, create and evaluate individual project concepts.
- All course work is public and open in a digital web-based format, with an emphasis on creating a public portfolio.
